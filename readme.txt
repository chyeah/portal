== Installing ==
* Download [http://codeigniter.com/ Codeigniter] and portal files.
* Upload both to webroot. Codeigniter system folder can be placed outside webroot folder.
* Edit index.php for your needs (system folder location and environment).
* Edit application/config/database.php.
* Run portal.sql to make database tables.
* Portal should now work, register a user and start using.
** Note: in database you must set permission to 10 to make your user to admin. You must logout and log back in before changes take effect.

Not yet stable. I wouldn't use it on live site just yet.
